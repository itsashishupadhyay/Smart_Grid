ELECTRIC POWER MARKET WITH INTERMITTENT GENERATION

We are discussing a stochastic market clearing
problem to deal with uncertainty in electric power generation.
These fluctuations arise due to several imperfections in weather
forecast data as well as multiple line loss constraints. These
forecast errors can give rise to imbalances in demand or supply or
both. The model presented in this paper compares scenarios with
variations in power generation from multiple sources. The
comparisons drawn are further analyzed in order to compute
price variations in all the scenarios
