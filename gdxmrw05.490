$TITLE test the Matlab mex-file gams (GDXMRW05,SEQ=490)

$ontext
Start Matlab in batch mode to run testinst.m.  You can also run
'testlib gdxmrw05' to extract the required files in the current dir,
start Matlab, and run testinst.m interactively.  In either case, the
log file 'testinstlog.txt' produced shows that the GAMS mex-interface
is working or helps to identify what the problems are.
